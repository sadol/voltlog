Voltcraft Power Supply Unit remote control tool.

1. Prerequisites:

    -   Pyro4
    -   pyserial
    -   matplotlib


2. Installation:

        Run mainServer.py (for example : ./mainServer -d /dev/ttyUSB0)
    on the server host connected to the PSU device in the local network.
    It is possibile to run this server in the remote network but you need
    to care about DNS and cryptography by yourself (see Pyro4 manuals).
    Default port number for the server is 50000.
        Server has been tested on Voltcraft PSP 12010 Power Supply only
    but it should handle other PSP models too. Please equip with good
    quality RS232/USB converter which should connect PSU with server PC.


3. Usage:

        Client program has GUI made in tkinter. Client`s main window is
    composed of three parts : server connection frame, job creation frame
    and plot frame. You need to successfuly connect to the PSU server to
    unblock other parts of main window . Disconnect , Stop and close window
    buttons turn off PSU immediately (and leave PSU in offline state in case
    of Disconnect and close window buttons)


4. Problems

        Voltcraft`s PSUs are not good quatity products so be prepared to
    somewhat sluggish response from device. Do not apply high frequency
    programs because of low responsivness and high risk of damage PSU`s relays.
